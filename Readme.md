# My first Streamlit project
La Jolla is one of the most beautiful and expensive places to live in San Diego, California.
This app predicts La Jolla house price based only on three features: area, number of bedrooms and number of bathrooms.

I collect data from online such as zillow, Redfin, Realtor, etc. There is no feature for type of properties such as condo, studio, apartment, or house.
Therefore, area-price correlation is not so consistent. This effects to the performance of the model.

Two different models (Multivaritate Linear Regression and Extreme Gradient Boosting) were applied for predicting house price.
